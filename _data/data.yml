    summary: |
      Hey! My name is Elias Varelas and I am an graduate student of Ionian University, Department
      of Informatics, based in Corfu, Greece. I was born in Alexandroupolis, which is located at the north-eastern part of Greece.
      I began experimenting with computers at the age of 7, first as a part of a big gaming community such as World of Warcraft and as I got older, 
      I started experimenting with hardware. At the age of 13 years old, I built my first gaming Computer. Up until this day, I still find interest in fixing
      old hardware and repurposing it to serve some everyday purpose.
